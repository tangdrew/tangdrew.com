Welcome to my digital garden! It is a collection of notes and thoughts in a varying range of baked-ness. It's also an experiment in learning out in the open.

## Why make a digital garden?

The popularity of digital gardens has begun to sprout (ðŸŒ±not sorryðŸŒ±) recently due to the work of awesome people like ..., but everyone has their own unique reasons why to set aside a little of their own corner of the internet to plant their garden. For me, it's to be more intentional in the way I learn. And I'm convinced the best way to do that is to develop a writing habit that sticks. And until I get off the waitlist for [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), building this place seemed like a decent place to start.

- To remember the things I read
- To be able to create more moments of (idea) connection
- To maybe help others learn one day
