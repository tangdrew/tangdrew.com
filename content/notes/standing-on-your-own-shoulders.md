The phrase "standing on the shoulders of giants" originates back to [at least the 12th century](https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/268025.html) and is most famous for being part of a letter from Isaac Newton to his rival Robert Hooke, saying _"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants."_. A lot of truth resonates in the phrase, but I think this variation also strikes a cord with me. It seems like leaps in thinking [TODO: sources] are the biproduct of the connection of previous research.

I really enjoy reading, but I find the learnings don't stick around long enough for connections to form. Solving that problem is a big reason I started this [[garden]].
